# Proposal
For this project, I decided on studying Cystic fibrosis. Cystic fibrosis is a disease affecting mostly the lungs and is seen mostly on caucasians. It is a autosomal recessive disease, thus it fits for this project. The related protein to this disease is called CFTR (cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator) protein. From wikipedia and its directed links, I learned that there is over 1500 mutations(for human genome) that can cause this disease, while the most common mutation make up two thirds of the total cases. This mutation is resulted by a deletion of three nucleotides, which results in a loss of phenylalanine, which affects the folding of the protein. Using genbank, I found a few genomes for different species and also some genomes with the disease causing mutations (including the most common mutation). I thought about comparing my findings about important regions with these mutations.
