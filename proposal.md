# Proposal
For this project, I decided on studying Woodhouse–Sakati syndrome. Woodhouse–Sakati syndrome is a multisystem disorder that can cause conditions such as alopecia, hypogonadism, hypothyroidism. It is an autosomal recessive disease, thus it fits for this project. This disorder results from a mutation in the C2orf37. I found a genome for this disorder on genebank, blased it and found very similar genes for various species. I also found out that this gene can also be called DDB1- and CUL4-associated factor 17. I have found some research on patients, but couldn't find any patient's genome yet.
